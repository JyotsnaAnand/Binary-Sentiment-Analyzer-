# Binary-Sentiment-Analyzer-
This repository has my implementation of a Binary Sentiment Analyzer which can classify customer reviews about products as positive/negative. 

The language used to implement the Sentiment Analyzer is Python. Python features an extensive library called 'NLTK' (Natural Language Tool Kit). NLTK has tools that are very useful for text processing, sentence and word classification. 

This project uses the Maximum Entropy Classifier to train the model and classify input as positive/negative. Online reviews sourced from web portals were used for training and testing.
